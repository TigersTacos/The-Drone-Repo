# The-Drone-Repo
A project I'm working on with drones and coding.
It is in beta version and doesn't really work, but feel free to try it out. The code is all written by me and @Turrnut, so don't expect fancy shmancy coding (especially not from me!) It will be very bad, but it won't require payment with this version and uses the same GPL as Linux, and is all Python (not gonna code Assembly.) Oh, and by the way: I will update it as much as I can, which is about monthly or every time I make a big advancement. Warning: This was all written in a crappy browser IDE, so stuff probably won't work as it should until I get VSCode on my School Computer (which I'm coding on) or I use my PC (too busy gaming.)
